# Scenes
Just to make it clear and simplify things a bit, I'd recommend taking a look at the [[Timeline|Timeline]], but the basic routes for #Chapter-1  are listed below:
1. Introduction to structures, "energy" management
2. Mining
3. Refining
4. Finding new planets/exploration (limited "autopilot" so we don't need to build a spaceship scene yet)
5. Simple, starter modules for the users

# Questions
## Mining
1. How to we organise mineral deposits as a "currency" (how can users "earn" them)? Do users just send out rovers, do they have to have a number of classifications of something?
2. What else can rovers classify? Are there close-up cameras on Percy/Curie that we can utilise here?
3. How many deployments should you have to make for a basic mineral deposit using the base model roover?

## Materials
1. How can we show refineries, pipelines, etc on the main mission page?
