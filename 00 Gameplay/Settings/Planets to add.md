Currently, we start off with 6 planets:

I'm proposing that we add a new set of planet candidates to the journey, for after the user has finished the tutorial on their first planet. They can then move on to new ones.

We need to ensure the following:
1. There's enough planets so that we don't run out of data (just like with everything else in [[Finished tutorials & unlimited data]])
2. The planets we add are all unconfirmed ones, otherwise there's not much use

Can we somehow link in with [Zooniverse Talk](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/nora-dot-eisner/planet-hunters-tess/talk/2112/3018942?page=1&scrollToLastComment=true)

Some candidates:
1. TIC 278683844
2. TIC 266980320 - not sure if unconfirmed
3. TIC 322307342
4. TIC 238176110
