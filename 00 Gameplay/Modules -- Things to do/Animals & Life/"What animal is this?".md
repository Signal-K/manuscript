We can set something up so that users can have a look for things in their local area, tag location, and share their creations/findings

We can use AI to determine if it's a fun thing (e.g. someone taking a photo of something that isn't really relevant, in which case it would be hidden from other users [in the feed]), or if it's actually relevant to a citizen science module (e.g. it could be a picture of an animal [["What animal is this?"]] [[Animals & Life]], or some rocks, or some astrophotography)
