Currently mission 10 and 15 is not included in the Build Structure with requirements component

In [[NWs S5 Week 3]], we'll be adding the following components:
1. [[PostCards (CPW-2)]]
2. Pokedex module
3. Classification feed
4. etc

So we may need to create some new missions / events

Now, I'm not sure if we need to explicitly write them inside `/api/gameplay/missions/route.ts`, however...we do need to come up with an explicit order of operations, and how users will discover each thing/concept

Maybe we can give the user a quiz and ask them what they'd like to do next, and point them in the direction...?

> What sounds interesting?

1. Exploring other planets and discovering new resources (insert more text to describe the benefits of establishing smaller bases on more planets, tying back into your first one; where resources are still being produced and structures are still pulling in data)
2. Discovering wildlife around you (in real life/in-game - separate the narrative from the real life aspect)
3. Finding out more about what you are seeing in the game

etc
Pokedex would be useful for #3 (clip it onto a telescope and your previous classification to compare with others users' and maybe find some new resources or whatever) and obviously would be useful for #2

This is something we'll need to work on


Right now, we need to have better control over user structures and other items, giving users more direction e.g. what comes in between our grand plan for automaton configuration and what we have now?

The only new mission will involve the pokedex (coming up with a new name for it will be a mission by itself to be honest)

# I want to get some feedback on the current order of missions, is it good enough?
