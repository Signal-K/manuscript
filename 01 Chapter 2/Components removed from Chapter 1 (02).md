This page houses a list of every component that we've built that isn't in #Earth #Chapter-1 (either it's been removed or isn't visible/accessible). Some of these components should be added back in #Chapter-2 .

## Structures
1. Available missions for structure (SSC-1)
> 	It will be useful when we update missions to reset based on profiles.activePlanet (e.g. “first classification” of a kind on each planet…hmm, actually that may be redundant as well), or when missions require certain types of planets (e.g. discover a volcano (not necessarily an active one) on a frozen world). Or when there’s multiple missions for one classification type in the structure.


## Classifications
> create a note in the relevant dir that will contain a pointer to the more advanced/specific data input e.g. “bands” in sunspot project

*SSC* board -> it's just varying levels of multiple choice, but eventually we'll be able to have some sort of "drawing-on" feature as part of classifications.

We'll need to add a "Field Guide" to show example images for the multi-choice answers
