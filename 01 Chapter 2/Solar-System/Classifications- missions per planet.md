We're going to need to have a think about the narrative about certain missions on these planets/entities, e.g. where does the life come from? Just pre-built habitats? Do users have to build the habitats?

So it's looking like in #Chapter-2 we'll be working with a lot of archived/older projects, #Chapter-3 the user has to find some planets and start populating them to be like #Earth to conduct live (and less related) projects, or they can go back to #Earth as well. If we can add in some characters and additional gameplay, then that could be a winning strategy. Maybe some projects like "Weather Rescue at Sea" could be used on #Earth to provide 

Users will eventually need to launch satellites that mimic their real-world counterparts...

Planet hunting will be enabled AFTER users finish some classifications on their new planet, maybe build some bases, whatever.
## Mercury

## Venus
1. [Cosmic Muon Images](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/reinforce/cosmic-muon-images/classify) 
	1. Volcanoes
## Earth
### Moon
1. [Count that neutrino](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/icecubeobservatory/name-that-neutrino/classify)
	1. Works in ice ( #Earth south pole)
## Mars
1. [Minor Planet](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/fulsdavid/the-daily-minor-planet/classify/workflow/22354) -
	1. Is useful/meaningful on planets close to the asteroid belt. However, we need to fix the grouped media issue.\
2. [Count that neutrino](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/icecubeobservatory/name-that-neutrino/classify)
	1. Works in ice ( #Earth south pole)
3. [Planet Four](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mschwamb/planet-four/classify)
	1. Can also be done from Phobos/Deimos - satellites
4. [AI for Mars](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/hiro-ono/ai4mars)
	1. Can be done from Phobos/Deimos?
## Jupiter
1. [Jovian Vortex Hunter](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ramanakumars/jovian-vortex-hunter/classify) - viewed from Amalthea?

2. Cryrovolcanoes?

### Titan
1. Cryrovolcanoes?
## Uranus
Users will likely have to inhabit Miranda or another of Uranus's moons
## Neptune
Users will likely have to inhabit Triton or another of Neptune's moons
## Pluto?
## Asteroids/comets?
