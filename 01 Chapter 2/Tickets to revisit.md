## Roovers/Generating
1. [SGV2-191](https://signalk.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SGV2/boards/8?selectedIssue=SGV2-191) -> api route for generating mineral deposits from user classifications, terrain generation (noise maps)? [[Terrain generation]][[Planet Generator]][[Automaton - Rover configuration]]
2. `SGV2-186`: [[Planet Generator]]should be based on number of classification types, not number of classifications
	1. Additionally, landscape images with depth/maps should be generated

## Greenhouse
1. [SGV2-146](https://signalk.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SGV2/boards/8?selectedIssue=SGV2-146) 
	> We’ve got some new ideas around gamification, exclusives/creation content so I’m going to move this out of the current epic/sprint, but we’ll bring it back once the “garden” module is in active development.  
		More details soon
	
	> For the most part, we’ve got ClassificationOutput creating rewards/additional entries based on the classificationProps so I think this has been achieved.
