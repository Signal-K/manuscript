Finish Mission Narrative, once-over of all open notes, get terrarium, update mission list with tutorial classification being the primary first

Locations will be based off of [[In-Game Locations]]
Users will choose what they'd like to do, and they fly in their spaceship to the new planet/space body and can begin setting up some structures and automatons. I want base building to become a feature/plotpoint in this chapter, and we can then implement terraforming in #Chapter-3 . Each chapter will be relatively "open-world" in that you can fly around to any location you've unlocked; for example if you start out #Chapter-2 on Jupiter>Io to classify volcanoes, and then decide you want to go back to #Earth to classify more animals, you can do that. 

We'll also be adding more content to previous locations/chapters as we go in each chapter.

I envision the end of #Chapter-2 occurring after the user has done some initial resource collection and base building, so they've got the resources and knowledge required to discover and travel to exoplanets, which is where #Chapter-3 will begin.

Crafting will also be added to the workflow in #Chapter-2 .

See [[Narrative megadoc dump]]for more

The mission schema will be relatively simpler. Users simply need to visit another location, make a classification and perform some research, and then they're free to find some new planet candidates. However, users will need to perform classifications "related" to their object/location, so Sunspots, TESS, etc won't be available (so we need to find some #Telescope #Data-Sources that are compatible with each object.). If resource collection comes into play, then we'll introduce a mission here as well, maybe researching rocket fuel or something. Mission awarding will be based on `profiles.location` 

### Extra add-ons
1. Going from [[Zoodex missions]], I think we could ask users to transport animals around to different habitats and help populate those planets for testing (reward early users)?
