Just send rovers out (no classifications for #Earth chapter), have a radius and a time of deploy, to find data sources. Mars will be where users start to go through rover photos to classify them and create deposits from there. Deposits will be generated an ever-increasing distance from where the user starts, until they reach the end of their plot. Once this happens, users will need to start mining deeper (deposits don't get destroyed, they just have multiple levels that get depleted over time.)

Users will then be able to manage their buildings in the Automaton Station, however for #Chapter-1  (on #Earth ) users will have all building done automatically, resource-free. #Chapter-2 , users won't be doing any classifications. I'm not even sure about resource collection at this point, either.
