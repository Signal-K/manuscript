1. ~~Would it be better to have users skip the onboarding chapter and just start on Earth? (I think this is probably the case because Earth is serving as the tutorial...including the first classifications?) [Component](obsidian://open?vault=Sailing&file=01%20Chapter%201%2002%2FComponents)~~ 
2. ~~There are a few bugs, but does the overall narrative make sense? The game loop should revolved around building structures, collecting resources and finding data to make classifications on. What should be changed to improve the narrative, make classifications more fun/engaging, etc? (can we link in with #PostCards / #Generator here?)~~

Now, no strict questions, just feedback form (open)
