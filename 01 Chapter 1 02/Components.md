I've realised that most of these components are going to come into play in #Chapter-2 so I'm moving them all to [[Components to-do]]
# Remaining #Tickets 
1. SSG-7:
	1. For now (according to [[Mission Narrative]]) users won't be doing anything with automatons, automations, or bots, so this can be removed from the current sprint AS SOON AS we confirm this to be the case (aka run the structure by the rest of the team)
2. SSP-2:
	1. We don't have the users or the content where old missions or items will cause issues yet, so this can also be dropped from the current sprint
3. SSP-9:
	1. For now I'm going to try to just show one item at a time due to the issues I have with showing all the media together, but I'll move this back to the #backlog until I run it by the rest of the team and determine what is the best course of action
4. SSP-10:
	1. First priority when we get back to the office
5. SSP-8:
	1. We also need to determine some new stats to show (and add these to the `anomalies.configuration` for the #Solar-System #anomalies , through the flask route)
