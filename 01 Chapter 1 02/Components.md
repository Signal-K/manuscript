1. Update the #Orbital structure display to take in the profile picture of the planet and any satellites as props
2. Insert original media - drip-feed
3. Semi-manual verification system - introduce users to #Starnet 
4. Convert anomaly data and `anomalies` types, settings
5. Sectors for #Planets ?
6. Factions/player pathways [[Narrative ]]

### Profile Form
`SGV2-143`
Maybe we have the #Profile #Form as part of the "requirement" to make your first classification, so we just drop the user on the planet with #CaptnCosmos guiding them? [[Questions for testers]]

# Components-per-mission
## Classification missions
1. Revised structure modal
2. Feed to show discoveries
3. Grab data
4. Post Form - will likely need to be revised to be more responsive and have the secondary options in the multiple choice configuration

### Bio classifications
1. Seeding will contain a list of available biological entities, a "selected" entity and a method to "add it to your ship" (to transport to the "next chapter"). However, since this is an "end-chapter" mission, I'm going to ignore it for now
2. Any specialised components for making the classifications (e.g. drawing on images) - waiting for product review on [[21-24 September 2024]]to go over the classifications we want to observe

## Structure missions
1. Buttons to upgrade, repair and otherwise administrate structure
2. Research new data (for classification structures)

### Researching
1. Show all available (unlocked and locked) research items, with the capacity to unlock these items (functional, but need to update the table structure and conduct a design review)

## Mining
(for mining from the "traditional" mineral deposit mechanic)
1. Show deposits
2. "inner deposit" (upon selecting a deposit)
3. Automaton select
4. Mining UI
All of these components have been completed AND are functional, but we just need to do a design review for what can change here

I think that these are the main components that are relevant, my question is is this enough from a narrative perspective?
We just need to move everything to Earth and come up with an order for initialising each component (not necessarily a narrative order, just something we can go off while building/testing)

Also, when does the #Surveyor come into this?

## Future
Anything to do with other #Planets can be ignored for now, e.g. terrain generation or terraforming
1. Terrain generation/landscaping (unless terrain understanding is of any relevance to #Earth ?)
