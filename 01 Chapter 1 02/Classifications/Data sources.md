[[02 Citizen Modules/Data Sources/Data Sources|Data Sources]]
I'm taking a look at citizen science projects that have accessible data sets like TESS > `lightkurve` due to the simple nature of collecting all the data and adding it to the database. I've found a few options that are available here:

## Space-based
1. https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zookeeper/galaxy-zoo/about/results

## Nature/Earth
1. https://github.com/pyinat/pyinaturalist

If we can't get enough material to automatically populate our infrastructure, we might need to reach out directly to the project maintainers or web-scrape. We need to determine what modules to include as the minimum.
