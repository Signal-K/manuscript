## Animals
### Wildwatch Burrowing Owl
![[Pasted image 20240927161211.png]]
> In this project, you will be reviewing a series of photos from motion-activated field cameras directed at burrowing owl nest entrances located in San Diego County. By identifying the owls and their approximate ages (juvenile or adult), behaviors, and other animal “visitors”, you will help researchers get a clearer picture of what burrowing owls are really up to.

![[Pasted image 20240927161337.png]]
> You will be identifying how many burrowing owls you see in each photo event. In each photo, select from the list of animals you see.

![[Pasted image 20240927161658.png]]
> Once you have found burrowing owls in the photos, choose how many you see and their approximate age. Do your best to select the behavior. <br /> You may come across photos without any animals (or people) in them, or shadows of burrowing owls. Just choose “Nothing Here” and move on. If you see an animal but it is blurry or dark, or you can only see a part of it, please give your best guess as to what it is.

![[Pasted image 20240927161814.png]]
> _Are there prey deliveries present?​_ <br />
> You should select “Yes” if you see an adult bird with prey in its beak, eating prey, or feeding something to chicks. Prey can include invertebrates, small birds, snakes, and small mammals.​ <br />
> _Do you see one of these behaviors?​_ <br />
> Select the “Feeding” button if you are able to see beak-to-beak contact (indicating prey was exchanged), but you are not able to see a prey item. Feeding can be between adults, between adults and juveniles, and between juveniles.​

![[Pasted image 20240927162956.png]]
> _Is there evidence of a predation or mortality event?​_ <br />
Unfortunately, you might catch a predation event of a burrowing owl. This photo is an example of a Cooper's Hawk depredating a juvenile burrowing owl. Predators can include raptors, ravens, and coyotes.​ <br />
Mortality events will include images of feather piles and carcasses of burrowing owls.

![[Pasted image 20240927163036.png]]
> A male may hop on top of a female for breeding purposes. If you see this, select "Mating".

![[Pasted image 20240927163115.png]]
> Occasionally if food resources are limited, parent birds will kill their offspring (infanticide). Remaining owls may eat the carcass (cannibalism). Siblings may also kill and eat weaker chicks (siblicide).​ If you see any of these behaviors, select "Infanticide".​
### South Coast Threatened Fauna Recovery Project
>We need your assistance in identifying who is in each photo. The cameras are set up to take a series of 3 to 5 photos every time it is triggered by a combination of motion and heat; i.e. every time an animal walks, hops or slides into view of the camera or when a piece of vegetation moves in front by the wind.
>
>Each camera is set 30cm's above the ground and the jarrah stake seen in most photos is 3m's from the camera and 30cm in height.

> The field guide is set up to help you identify photos. It is grouped by fauna groups and has handy tabs like **Birds at a glance**, **Ears** and **Tails** for distinguishing those tricky images.
> 
> Flick through each photo in the set to find identifiable features of each individual to help with identification.
>
> The **Birds at a glance** section has photos of every bird on the species list.
> And the **Ears** and **Tails** section has comparison photos head and body shapes of our most confusing small mammals.


> Can't see who it is? or Can't see anything at all? Don't worry, that's possible.
Firstly check each set of images to ensure you aren't missing a small mammal, either of mouse size or smaller.
Unsure of the identification as it's only ears, a bit of tail, a blur or tuff of fur? Have a look at the _Field Guide_ under these categories and see if you can match the shape of the features you see.
If you still can't work it out you can use our broader categories of _bird_, _small mammal_, or _reptile_.

> Once you have successfully identified the individual, the system will ask you a couple of questions:
_How many individuals?_  
This is the number of individuals of that species you can see in the image, and does include young animals that you can see part of their body. _i.e._ A head or leg sticking out of a pouch.
_Can you see young?_
This is a _Yes/No_ answer and only includes pouch young when part of their body is sticking out of the pouch.
**If you can see a cat or a fox it will ask:**  
_Does the cat or fox have prey?_
This is a _Yes/No_ answer to help us identify predation events. If a cat or fox has a native animal in its mouth or is playing with it in its paws; please click _Yes_.
**If you can see a Mouse or smaller it will ask:**  
_Can you see stripes?_
This helps us to identify _Honey possums_ from any other small mammal.

### Iguanas from above
![[Pasted image 20240926201730.png]]
> We need your help to know **how many marine iguanas** are living in the Galápagos. This tutorial will help you identify them in the images. Iguanas can be rare, so please note that when you don't find any.

![[Pasted image 20240926201907.png]]
> Search for iguanas following a zigzag pattern, **look carefully and slowly!** Remember the lizard-shape when looking.

![[Pasted image 20240926201923.png]]
> You will find different types of iguanas. **ADULT MALES** are bigger and could be more colourful. If you see an aggregation of grey iguanas around a big coloured male, this is called a **LEK** (reproductive group)!

![[Pasted image 20240926202045.png]]
> If your adult male has a lek, select the option **Adult male with a lek**, if is alone select the option **Adult male not in a lek.** 

![[Pasted image 20240926202057.png]]
> If you find an iguana **cut** by any side of the image, please mark it with the option **partial iguana**

Later -
> Marine iguanas share their habitat with other species, mostly **crabs, sea lions, birds, sea turtles, plants and algae**. This is very useful information for us, so please take the opportunity to search and mark them too!
> 
> Sometimes you will find **plastic objects** like bottles and fishing nets. It is very important that we also collect these data. If you see any please mark all of them **in the middle**! If it is obviously a bottle, please mark it **bottle**. If it is obviously a net, rope, or other equipment for fishing, please mark **fishing gear**. Include here bamboo sticks (could belong to fish aggregation devices - FADs). You might also find fragmented plastics, mark once. For all other plastic objects, please mark **other/unknown plastic**.

## Nest Quest Go
>We are going to collect the detailed information from this nesting attempt, such as the number of eggs and young. One card represents **ONE nesting attempt.** Each row is one visit to the nest by the observer.

> There are several versions of cards. Some of this data is on the front of cards, and some is on the back of the card. Depending on the card you are transcribing, you may have to flip the card to find the data before you can begin.

> We are asking participants to transcribe the **numerics** for the MONTH, DAY, NUMBER OF EGGS, AND NUMBER OF YOUNG.

> **Number of Eggs and Number of Young** will often have 0 (zeros), blanks, and check marks or other marks. Here is how we would like those transcribed:
> - Zeros = 0
>   - Blanks = b
>     - Check Mark or any mark (including Y, N, ?, etc.) = m
>     - 98 and 99 should be entered as numbers
>   - Scratched entries should be included, if possible. No need to specify the data is scratched.

> **IF you get a card with a skipped row,** please feel free to only include the rows of data that are completed. No need to comment that the observer skipped a row or to include a skipped row.
> Cards that have rows with scratched out data all the way through should be transcribed as though the scratch out line were not there. We would like to retain this data as much as possible.

> Some observers put a range for the number of young, especially when they could not see the nest contents clearly. Please err on the conservative side and include the lowest of the number range.
> For cards that have a range of dates for one or multiple lines of data such as the one pictured, please use the **LATEST DATE** for that line.


# Telescope
## Radio telescopes
### SETI - Are we alone?
![[Pasted image 20241001075122.png]]
> Help us classify our single-line narrowband SETI data! Single-line narrowband emissions are often hypothesized to be how ET might initially signal their presence. But they can be hard to classify properly, and we need your help with the classification task.

Updated/custom -
> Your telescope has now been upgraded to track narrowband emissions that could be signs of alien life trying to get in touch with us - you can now help classify these signals and work with the community to find where in our universe they might be

![[Pasted image 20241001075256.png]]
> Here is an example of an image you will see. The white line is a signal, the black background is noise.

![[Pasted image 20241001075331.png]]
> Ccount the number of times the line zigs or zags horizontally. Any line with 3 or more shifts should be classified as jagged. The signal in this example could be classified as straight.

![[Pasted image 20241001075356.png]]
> This would be an example of a jagged signal

![[Pasted image 20241001075414.png]]
> If you see a wide signal, more than one bright white line, or a white line that doesn't reach from the top of the image to the bottom of the image, or if you are not sure how to classify, you can let us know by selecting the option for something else ("Gaps/Multiple lines/Other").

![[Pasted image 20241001075436.png]]
> Images like these where the lines on the sides are about as bright as the center line should be classified as "Gaps/Multiple lines/Other".


## Sunspot detective
"Just tell us how many individual sunspots you see"

![[Pasted image 20240925210349.png]]
> You will be shown small subsets of the sunspot drawings and you would have to input the number of spots you see in the text box below

![[Pasted image 20240925210428.png]]
> For this exercise, as spots we refer to all dark markings made by the observer to represent a solar feature. That includes small dots, like the ones shown on the right side of this image, but also bigger structures like the one on the left. In this example one should count 6 spots as marked on the right panel.

![[Pasted image 20240925210232.png]]
> The image sizes vary significantly because each includes only a single group of sunspots. You do not need to zoom in the images to search for smaller features, as these would only be smudges.


![[Pasted image 20240925210303.png]]
> Pay attention to not count as spots the various lines, writings, and smudges that these images have



## Disk detective
![[Pasted image 20240926092245.png]]
> Find stars with hidden disks of dust around them. These stars show us where to look for new planetary systems and teach us about how planets form

![[Pasted image 20240926092311.png]]
> The ideal disk candidate is a **single, round source, contained mostly within in the outer circle in all of the images.** It may move a bit from image to image, but it does not move beyond the inner circle.

![[Pasted image 20240926092335.png]]
> As you go through the images, pay attention to the label in the upper right hand corner. This label indicates what survey the image is from, i.e., which telescope took the image.

![[Pasted image 20240926092520.png]]
>  You'll be looking for different features in the images from different surveys. For example, images from the Pan-STARRS survey are especially good at revealing objects like galaxies that are not round. The last image (unWISE w3),from the WISE telescope, is especially good at revealing interstellar dust clouds.

# LIDAR
## Martian Clouds
![[Pasted image 20240927170925.png]]
> <strong>We need your help finding clouds in Mars's atmosphere.</strong> <br />
> The Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter observes the atmosphere in the infrared to determine the temperature and ice and dust content.  
Its measurements point to water-ice clouds and carbon-dioxide clouds at very high altitudes.

![[Pasted image 20240927171303.png]]
> Clouds have been observed at Mars by various instruments on several orbiters (and rovers!). But there are so many clouds, a single individual cannot find them all on their own. With help from you and other citizen scientists, we think tens of thousands of these clouds can be identified!

![[Pasted image 20240927171146.png]]
> As your spacecraft moves through its orbit, clouds appear to rise from behind the atmosphere to a higher altitude and then fall again. This leads to an arch-like shape in the data. The peak of the arch is the real location of the cloud.

![[Pasted image 20240927171310.png]]
> You'll be presented with images that span four hours worth of MCS observations. From left to right, time moves forward as the spacecraft moves through its orbit. The vertical axis represents altitude (from 0 to 100 km) -- you'll see the brighter lower atmosphere on the bottom fading out higher in the atmosphere above. But sometimes high-altitude clouds appear as arches! Your goal is to search for arches like this. <br />
> 
> <strong>To decide if something is an arch, look for two distinct legs and a peak </strong><br />
> 
> Tell us what shape you see, how many clouds, and then the rough location

![[Pasted image 20240927171419.png]]
> Remember, you're looking for an arch with **two legs and a peak**. There are several bright streaks in the zoomed-in image below, but only the one on the left has two legs with a clear gap in between and a peak at the top.

![[Pasted image 20240927171435.png]]
> Most images have about 2-3 arches. Here's an example with just 1-2:

![[Pasted image 20240927171443.png]]
> Many have several arches throughout (sometimes more than 10): (^)

![[Pasted image 20240927171508.png]]
> Others have none at all:

![[Pasted image 20240927171519.png]]
> You're ready to begin cloudspotting on Mars!
