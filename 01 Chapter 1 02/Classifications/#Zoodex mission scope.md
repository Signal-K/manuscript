# [[01 Chapter 1 02/Classifications/Data sources|Data sources]]
1. #BurrowingOwls - from #Zooniverse 
2. More to come

Perhaps we also include a #zoodex-upload module for plants? 
# Steps & Missions
The components that make up the #zoodex structure:
1. Each classification option/component (e.g. #BurrowingOwls)
2. Upgrade (to unlock new data sources)
3. Repair/increase durability
4. View discoveries

I think researching will be limited to unlocking new functionality and structures, not additional data sources (maybe some data sources might need some specialised tutorials but I'm not sure how to separate things beyond that)

I need to create a way to filter the discoveries by `classifications.classificationConfiguration[structureid]` but I think that all classifications should be able to be viewed by each structure. (See [[01 Chapter 1 02/Bug Report|Bug Report]])

Perhaps there should be a step to construct some inner parts to the #Greenhouse / habitat structures so that there's a construction mechanic. We could bring it back to the #Surveyor statistics for planets, where only certain sources are available depending on the planet/habitat statistics. This also be relevant to introducing the #terraforming mechanics.

After completing a classification of a data source, any #zoodex structure the user builds is then able to start with that animal (provided the animal is able to "survive" on the planet based on the statistics). e.g. users will maybe classify owls and fish on #Earth , and then the next planet they go to, when they create a Zoodex structure, will be able to choose from the ones they've classified (if the planet type is relevant). Users will receive some information about the planet type they're visiting and will be warned if they need to research some additional data sources.

Perhaps we'll require the construction of #habitats inside the #Greenhouse structure e.g. we'll require colonisation of a river or construction of a "river habitat" for fish investigation.
# Structure configuration
1. Uses
2. Unlocked data sources

# Dialogue
#Automatons  will be used to "keep an eye" on your plants/animals, additionally they'll be where the photos of your objects of interest (anomalies) are coming from. We might need to introduce a mechanic to upgrade your #Automatons to be able to take water photos, for example.

There will be multiple Automaton types, not just rovers/mineral collecting rovers.
