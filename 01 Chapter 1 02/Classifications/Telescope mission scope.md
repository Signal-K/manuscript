# Data sources
## Motivation & relevance
Modules like #sunspot investigations can be used to predict the habitability, terrain & long-term planetary evolution of a planet. Another potential [[Starter flask routes]]
I would like to also have a think about "launching" telescopes and orbitals that link in with the surface-based structure

Could habitability be something else we use the telescope to look at the current planet (maybe to get an "outsiders" perspective) when the planet "has life"?
