1. Structures can't be opened, closed and then opened again without a refresh
2. Do we just reset the state (not db field) for "activeStructure" when clicking out of the modal?
3. Inner modal not resizing correctly, I also think we should add a colour gradient or other decorative scope to make it stand out a bit more
4. ~~"What do you think about..." form component~~
5. If there are multiple rovers on a user's [instance of a ] planet, the mining scene won't work
6. `structureid` for `classifications.classificationConfiguration` not working at all.

~~Is `activePlanet` being set correctly during #Onboarding ?~~

1. ~~Fix image collection issue, bug around “uses” during #Onboarding -> this isn't going to be fixed, though, as we're removing the onboarding (or replacing it)~~
