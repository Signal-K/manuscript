Remember to please answer every question by the end of the day if possible

1. Separate structure for #Greenhouse compared to #zoodex  - where do these come in?
2. [[In-Game Locations]] -> Something interesting that does pop up is an answer to the question about the relevance of using #Telescope to discover things on the planet you're on - it would be like launching satellites, you'd get more usable data on an "airless" world like Mars than you would on #Earth . It does remind me as well that I would like to determine a relevance of each anomaly discovery to the current anomaly.
3. We also need to have a think about the lore/backstory behind each module component (e.g. #zoodex #BurrowingOwls )
