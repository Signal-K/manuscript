Basic parameters (for now):
1. Temperature (include a module for stellar stats?)
2. Size of planet
3. Validity of planet (overall users' #Classifications )
4. Distance
5. Spectroscopy output...
6. Cloud output...
7. Liquid solvent... (or primary gas, dependant on size)

Post cards could also be generated for landscapes, as "scenes" or "landscapes" as child objects of the #planet #PostCards 

Need to determine which structures provide which parameters, and if any parameters need to be updated [[Chapter 1-2 Mission List]]
