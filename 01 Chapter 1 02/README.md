I think for each chapter, we'll have a folder for each ticket divided across the different project boards, as well as pages for everything that changes (e.g. #Database configurations). 

We should also include a document for the following: 
* Timeline/Narrative, 
* Mission List, 
* Component Overview
* Data sources
