I'm thinking that we make different classifications available for real (and understood, in the context of different modules) space bodies, and we can then extend it to find similar objects and colonise those. E.g. users start on Earth, where they get a little bit of everything (as all data goes to Earth), but to get more resources or more (specialised) data, they have to go to other planets or asteroids. Then, we can treat those bodies as the "training" bodies and also have a set of extra-solar bodies for other specialties, and go from there with giving users more bodies to classify and "colonise".

I do want to think about how this affects the narrative regarding alien life, player factions (if everyone comes from Earth) and how we can treat multiple users on the same planet (maybe introduce sectors or have everyone on a shared space?). The key question is where do other planets come into it?

Something interesting that does pop up is an answer to the question about the relevance of using #Telescope to discover things on the planet you're on - it would be like launching satellites, you'd get more usable data on an "airless" world like Mars than you would on #Earth . It does remind me as well that I would like to determine a relevance of each anomaly discovery to the current anomaly.
