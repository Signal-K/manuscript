Questions:
~~Why are we classifying animals? Where do they come from?~~
2. Actually, why are we doing anything? This needs to be explained to the users specifically
	1. When the user chooses each mission, we need to explain to them exactly where the data comes from (from an in-game/narrative lore perspective, not in a literal sense), why they're classifying it, etc
3. Explain to the users their ability to keep classifying using their existing structures, move on to new ones, again why...from a "completing our understanding of your planet" perspective #Generator 

[[Overall narrative]]
I also want to better organise how #mineralDeposits are generated based on #RoverPhotos

We'll also introduce a mechanic where the user has to send out probes to find a safe landing site for their new #Planets 

# What mechanics need to be introduced?
1. Introduce users to structures
2. Introduce users to making classifications (after the user chooses which classification they'd like to be their first)
3. Introduce users to researching new structures, then building those structures, then unlocking new data sources, and then being able to make a classification
4. Allow the users to access the "Planet Switcher"

This essentially covers the basics of each component, specific classification missions will have their own tutorial that will be more specific, but the general flow will be the same:
1. What are we classifying?
2. How/what are we looking for?
3. What are the options?
4. Making the (first) classification
