1. ~~How do we construct the missions so that users are able to "finish" #Chapter-1 regardless of if they do 2 or 4 #Classifications , and do we give additional missions for completing introductory classifications on the first planet?~~
2. How do we keep track of the user's planets history, what their first planet was, etc (beyond looking at the order of entries in the `classifications` table)

Code-components I want to implement: [[Components to-do]]
Overall, I want to have the following mechanics in #Chapter-2 :
1. New classification objects:
	1. Volcanic activity
	2. #zoodex uploader
	3. Simple terrain generation & terraforming
	4. More weather events
	5. Stars, other #Telescope modules
	6. More #zoodex research objects e.g. fishing (can maybe introduce a #sandbox mechanic based off this)
2. New #Mechanics for the user:
	1. Refining & crafting, automation pipelines
	2. Simple flying (vehicles/spaceships) storyline
	3. Terraforming
3. Bring it all back to the central narrative, start introducing some collaborative/multiplayer events (a pre-cursor to the community #events I've discussed previously)


#Chapter-3 or beyond, we'll start looking into how we can make these data sources more realistic for the planet the user is on (not Earth-based) by simulating things and hopefully increasing our users' understanding of their bodies, e.g. customising how data sources behave based on #Surveyor statistics. Not really sure how to do this, we really need to figure out where the content is being driven (the planet or the #fill-in content). Ideally, we have more of an idea, at least from a #Narrative perspective, at the end of finishing #Chapter-2 . If we can come up with an operational perspective as well for when we start handing our data back to research groups, even better.

Fred needs to handle dialogue and #Narrative insertion 

### I'll need to review these pages:
1. [[01 Chapter 1 02/Classifications/#Zoodex mission scope|#Zoodex mission scope]]and other values in that dir
2. [[Player type choice]]
