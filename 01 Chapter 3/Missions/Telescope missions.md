# Some key points
1. Classifications are relatively straightforward and open to interpretation, e.g. equilibrium temperature estimates vs "unaltered"/static temperature differences can lead to a different #Surveyor view of the #planet )
2. Exoasteroids could be used to populate exomoons?

Early-on, users will need to determine the base stats of their new planet, and compare with the "confirmed" findings...(this is probably something for exoplanets, where we have lightcurves we can use...not sure what early-game measurements users can make for bodies in our #Solar-System )

Update - since we aren't dealing with exoplanet content until #Chapter-3 , I'm moving this to that section
