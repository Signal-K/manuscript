This page is for to-dos that are a little bit more complex to pull off, but are still firmly in the pipeline for the near-immediate future (as opposed to things like the full-on Unity 3d game, which is still a while away)

Same convention as [[Global & Internal To-Do]]

1. Create a visual tilemap based on the user's structures and setup on their planet

Now that we've got the [[Structure Modals]] [[Structures]] design set up, I do want to mention that eventually I want it to look more in-line with a traditional dashboard/control panel as opposed to the current vertical column with buttons interface, but we're a ways away from that at the moment
