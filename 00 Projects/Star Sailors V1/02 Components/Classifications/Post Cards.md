Idea: Interactive landscape on the left, classifications as images on the right (maybe as a carousel). Footer showing profile information, basic stats & link/qr code. Obviously single column on mobile?

Let's try this and then adjust the landscape so it feels like something out of Voidpet later on.

I feel like an improved UI would show your progress (via the post card, swipe vertically through those to view others), your base and then an inventory/main menu. So maybe a three panel layout (swiping).

We'll have a menu for customisation/configuration of your landscape (note: not necessarily a planet).
