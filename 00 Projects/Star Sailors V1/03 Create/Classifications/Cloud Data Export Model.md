We need to come up with how we can link it back to Mars (just like the rover images) - right now the in-game narrative is this data is coming from the activePlanet. We need to come up with a narrative point to describe how it's coming from Mars in-game as well...what's the relation?
Wormhole where data flows through lol?
How does this affect our knowledge of the new anomaly/planet [candidate] too?
