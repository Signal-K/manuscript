CPW-8:
>Is there something we could do with logging user classifications and generating something?  
Maybe to start with (from a microservice perspective) → simple completion. Check if user has classified rover image, lightcurve, sector/cloud, etc

Or potentially it could be used for “organisation”. i.e. “this image apparently (according to the user/submitter) has x, y, and z, which doesn’t make sense based on other classifications on this planet”. However, since we are using rover data specifically just from Mars, for multiple planets, this may not work.

Maybe the output could be passed into the generator, like a “draw what you say you see” model.
