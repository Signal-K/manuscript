We will un-archive the `gizmotronn/media` repository and re-assign it to `signal-k/stream`

We will use Wasp
Minimum requirements will be to fetch all content from `classifications` table and put them into a feed that identifies the user, the anomaly referenced, and any additional metadata.

My biggest potential gripe with Wasp is the (apparent) lack of PWA support, but we'll see. We can always deeplink it in with the main frontend later (which does have PWA capabilities)
