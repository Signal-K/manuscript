# By mission
Mission 1 (Choosing your planet):
> Start your journey here. Choose a planet that you think looks fun and interesting. You'll start building your base and discovering the planet as you go, and you'll be able to visit other planets later

Mission 2 (Profile) -> we're moving this

Mission 3 (Spacecraft pilot to planet)
> Start exploring your planet: Click on your spacecraft here and pilot it to your new home. You'll then be able to start building and exploring your surroundings

[[Global & Internal To-Do]] : Can we add some sort of "viewport" so that we can see pictures of the planet as a "screensaver"-type experience (the more modules/[[00 Archive/Test/Structures]] you have, the more content/types of wallpapers you'll have e.g. rover photos)

Mission 4 (Undeployed) -> remove undeployed mechanic, automatically set the location (still have an intermediary stage where it's undeployed for future expansion of this concept).
> Structures are tools for exploring the planet and discovering their vast ecosystems

Mission 5 (Build first automaton) & Mission 6 (Deploy automaton and collect resources)
> Click this button to build your first automaton rover. These little critters explore the planet for you and collect resources! You'll need to collect some resources to build your first telescope, so click this button to build your first one!


> Your automaton has found a mineral deposit already, nicely done! Click on the deploy button to collect the resources

Mission 7 (Build your telescope):
> You can now upgrade your existing telescope to receive transit information, allowing you to discover different planets and validate your own. Click this button to complete the upgrade using the resources you just collected

[[Global & Internal To-Do]] -> (link in with the upgrade modal buttons in [[00 Archive/Test/Structures]] 12 modal)

Mission 8 (Your first classification):
> Describe what you see and if you think it's a planet
(Upgrade with some information on what to look for in the curve)
