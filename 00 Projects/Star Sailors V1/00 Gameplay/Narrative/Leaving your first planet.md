After you've finished your base set of missions, you'll be given the option to stay on your home planet and continue classifying things you find there, or you'll be able to go and explore other planets. You'll of course be able to return to previous planets/settings (locations) whenever you wish.

The first set of planets are all relatively similar terrestrial entities, which means that resources like hydrogen, helium, methane etc won't be in extreme supply. So visiting other planets will be useful if you want to collect those resources (note: we'll need to add a different layout for gaseous (for e.g.). Maybe the user can classify the planet type, think of the "visiting planet" scene in Unity for inspo)

However, even after finishing the first set of classifications on your first planet, there are still plenty of other things to discover. Since you've started off with a base and some mines, you'll be able to more quickly accumulate resources and further establish your outpost. Additionally, there are new missions (like wildlife observations) that can be unlocked with new structures.

In short, here are the benefits for either option:
1. Leaving asap -> collect a more varied set of resources and establish a thin, stretched "empire", leaving a lot of variety and options for things to do and ensuring you'll never be lacking in a specific type of object/resource (provided you explore a lot)
2. Staying a bit longer -> increase your collection of "terrestrial-typical" resources (so a larger collection of a more specific resource), and new missions are faster to come by
