**8/7/24**
1. Star Sailors -> come up with full list of structures, order of operations, and design/layout (maybe some new missions are required)

Notes:
* Add a way to toggle the tutorial visibility
* More data needs to be added
* Maybe an open view of their planet for mining, building, exploring (that could be the side scrolling view. Maybe a bunch of different panels, swipe between them. Can navigate between structure views, automaton views, etc. I want to have a chat with Rhys asap about this, however)
* Currently mineral resources are just being pulled out of nowhere, creating a new table (locally) to show the list of resources, clicking on them, selecting the tool to mine them with might be better
	* Creating a view for the automatons to show their discoveries (deposits, anomalies (alien sightings!), photos, etc).
	* This means that the camera stations/automaton modules won't need separate structure views as they're just clipping on?
