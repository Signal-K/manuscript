20th July 2024
Copernic:
1. Plan out proposed roadmap for Copernic
2. Contact Chol, arrange dinner?
3. Reach out to Katie about accounting requirements

Nordkurve:
1. Evaluate technical milestones & current infrastructure components
2. Strip landing page/index route
3. Make sure stripe webhook still works

#Star-Sailors :
1. Identify order of operations for current Jira tickets
	1. Go through current structure modals and get the internal pages & content introduced into the workflow
	2. Determine an end and start point for each chapter. Maybe come up with some community events/brainstorming sessions so the community is involved in the creation? - what's the best way to pump out content?
2. New background, post card, new planet & a community event
	1. Dynamic background for planets
	2. New planet areas, narrative and simplified navigation
	3. Show, deploy, share, get feedback
3. Anything else is a bonus, go over [[Planet list - Anomalies|Planet list - Anomalies]] again and get some feedback for the new base set.
4. Where do we show the planet card in the current user flow? Just have it as a progression button/panel along the bottom for now?
	1. Show users a progression bar, explain to them in today's push about the upcoming changes and also the shareable card, get the new avatars in.
	2. Go over `user_anomalies` table again


25/7
1. Each task you complete, contributes to the player learning how to play the game. how to use all the basic mechanics.
2. Start creating a narrative from the spaceship, rather than from the planet surface (i.e. you're not on the planet yet, until it's confirmed)
	1. View for planet landscape, as well as the "from space" orbital view
	2. Rovers/automatons are used to map out the terrain
	So maybe the narrative starts with them choosing their ship based on their initial interests and then doing a little bit of everything on their ship
	Narrative-wise, you're initially interacting with the structures from your spaceship (so your spaceship would start off with some "weak" structures that can do some limited interactions with the planet, but you'll need to build structures on the planet to get the full "power")
3. There needs to be something special about each area/setting - a resource or item that can be collected (or rewarded), for example. For sandbox games, players are motivated by different things - building the base, collecting resources using mega farms, exploring, etc. So there needs to be something to do/achieve that hits every playstyle and is related to every citizen science module we implement

What is the simplest spaceship UI we can implement?
1. How much information & interactions do we need to support initially? That determines the UI requirements
2. Is the swipey/snapchat format for the UI panels worth doing? Do we try and implement the progress bar/loop mechanic visibly into the workflow?

Create a component list for the first two tutorial sets and then set up a position where there's a "collect, classify, share, deploy" loop in the first tutorial set. Bit of brief information and then a limited sandbox environment for the first tutorial set, that should hopefully be sufficient for Week 6.
Then we can implement set 2, and then the community events, which is probably (initially) reliant on the RSV resources to connect with the universities.

**Finish planet grid** 

# August 2024
## August 7 (Wednesday)
1. Plan out requirements for #Copernic
2. Plan out requirements for #SERA #Summer
3. Build contract for #SERA #Summer 
4. Frontend components for #SERA #Summer 
5. Close 5 branches (log) for [[Linear projects|Linear projects]] ( #Star-Sailors )
6. Create Jira tickets and set up new components in [[Onboarding|Onboarding]] ( #Star-Sailors )
	1. Let's also review what chatgpt came up with, compare with what we have and what needs to be added (e.g. is there something missing from the tickets/components?)
7. Write down some notes in #Obsidian, identify the current open pages #Editing and look at a template for new projects #Personal 
8. Two components for #Copernic 
9. Go through this page [[July 2024 - Melbourne|July 2024 - Melbourne]] ( #Star-Sailors )
10. Unarchive tabs & note down from Arc #Personal
11. Move around 20 tickets in TickTick #Personal #Star-Sailors 
12. Determine requirements (and potential changes) for #zoodex ( #Star-Sailors )
13. Anything that comes up for #Nordkurve #nk12 
14. Move everything into another Archive directory inside #Obsidian , create a schema that will be consistent with Confluence and look into push/pull, simplify into frontend, backend, gameplay/chapters for now
15. It would be good to look into how we can structure a legacy behaviour/mode for #Star-Sailors  (both V1.0 and the beta for V2.0)

Media:
1. Death In Paradise: Man Overboard
2. TD: TRR ep 1
3. Maybe a movie?
4. 1 comic, 1 SW comic
5. Minceraft Planning

Personal:
1. Load of washing
2. Clean out desk & cupboards, reorganise & prioritise
