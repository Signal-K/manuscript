So now we're at the point where the first set of missions have been completed. As a refresher, here were the first set:

```
const missions: Mission[] = [
    { id: 1, name: "Pick planet", description: "Select your starting planet", rewards: [29] }, // Possibly the user should get something, but really they're already getting a planet, so... | After further consideration for the order of missions, I think that giving the spaceship and then the rover will be a good option
    { id: 2, name: "Complete profile", description: "Fill in your profile data", rewards: [22] }, // Give them a rover/automaton without a location, we'll create a button that keeps track of the item that was created and show the user an option to "place" un-locationised items/structures
    { id: 3, name: "Go to planet", description: "Land on your home planet", rewards: [] }, // Empty/stub mission, purely to determine if the user visits their planet.
    { id: 3, name: "Build vehicle structure", description: "Now you do this, you'll be able to create automatons", rewards: [] }, // Empty/stub mission, purely for the user to make the Vehicle Structure. Will give them an automaton, however, as we currently don't have a crafting recipe for it. Actually, we don't need to do this, as the first automaton is always fee (see Automaton.tsx)
    { id: 5, name: "First automaton", description: "Build your first automaton to explore your planet", rewards: [13, 13, 13, 16, 16] }, // Give them the resources required to build the Telescope Signal Receiver
    { id: 6, name: "Deploy automaton", description: "Deploy an automaton for the first time", rewards: [13, 13, 15]}, // User will receive the components required to build item id 14, as well as whatever the automaton finds
    { id: 7, name: "Build telescope", description: "Build a telescope & subsequent modules to learn more about your planet", rewards: [13]}, // Meaningless/stub reward
    { id: 8, name: "Make classification", description: "Classify the validity of your planet by looking at your TIC ID", rewards: [13, 13, 13, 16] ,} // Gives the user the constituent parts to make a surveyor module for their telescope
];
```

So where did the user finish after completing their first set of missions?
* They've now got an automaton, telescope with module `14` attached, and they've made their first classification.

I'm wondering where should we next direct the user? Essentially, as part of this first mission group, they've gone through a sort of large onboarding process, a very large page. In the long run, the game will consist of them flying or otherwise travelling to different locations/anomalies, discovering things and making classifications on real-world data points (this may consist of "travelling" to black holes or making observations on the number of burrowing owls in some photos). The second mission group, which is the next thing we'll be developing, will consist of setting up your colony on your new planet and getting resources so you can expand your network, as well as beginning some new classifications. You've already started to classify the validity of your planet through identifying TIC id graphs, so now we'll be looking at cloud formations and photos from your rover/automaton (which will really be photos from the real mars rovers that users will be classifying).

Automatons will be used to fetch the resources, so we'll need a mining & construction facility.

Eventually the user will be able to just do their own thing, whatever they want, but we need them to get to a point where they're (in the game) self-sufficient in terms of their resources & technology.

Here was a draft of the next 5 missions I came up with (for mission group 2):

1. **Discover Cloud Formations**
    - Objective: Use the Meteorology tool to identify and classify different cloud formations on your home planet.
    - Completion Criteria: Successfully classify three unique cloud formations using the Meteorology tool.
    - Reward: Unlock the Cloud Spotter module for the Meteorology tool, allowing for more accurate cloud identification.
2. **Establish Resource Mining**
    - Objective: Locate and establish a resource mining operation on your home planet.
    - Completion Criteria: Deploy a rover equipped with a resource scanner to locate mineral deposits.
    - Reward: Access to a new mission to construct a mining facility.
3. **Construct Mining Facility**
    - Objective: Build a mining facility to extract resources from mineral deposits.
    - Completion Criteria: Gather the necessary materials and construct the mining facility structure.
    - Reward: Start generating resources passively from the mining facility.
4. **Expand Observatory Network**
    - Objective: Expand your observatory network to improve anomaly monitoring capabilities.
    - Completion Criteria: Build a Transiting Telescope structure adjacent to your Telescope Signal Receiver.
    - Reward: Enhanced anomaly detection and monitoring capabilities.
5. **Research Anomaly Survey**
    - Objective: Conduct a comprehensive survey of anomalies using the Surveyor tool.
    - Completion Criteria: Deploy the Surveyor tool and gather data on at least three anomalies.
    - Reward: Unlock advanced anomaly analysis tools and insights.


Obviously these will be changed around as we already have a structure 14/transiting telescope, however we could look into expanding the network with cameras on your automatons that link back to your telescope network, thus potentially requiring the creation of a new module for your telescope?

My question is, can you help me determine how best to go about building out this narrative for the end-user? After completing their first classification with their transiting telescope, what next?
