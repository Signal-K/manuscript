We need to come up with a model for all of our citizen science modules for them to actually be useful to scientists/researching

The first thing that comes to mind is the rover photos setup

We'll need to edit/remove `SGV2-62` so that minerals aren't being burned between missions.
Maybe we just move them to a new planet? It could be as simple as in the tutorials, you can't use your previous resources (note: not structures/automatons) until after completing them?

Go through [[First Mission Group - SGV2-40 Retrospective]] for any functionality changes that need to be made

We need to update the classification schema so that we can create posts that function like multiple choice questions e.g. "do you see *x*"
