# Things to look into
[Pre-Sprint 2 | Questions](obsidian://open?vault=Liam's%20vault&file=02%20Design%2FQuestions%2FPre-Sprint%202) 
1. Entity switcher -> overflow for more than 2/3 automatons/structures
2. Rich-context background images
3. Context vs Parent menu items

# State of the user - where are we at?
Now that our users have made a handful of classifications and have started to populate their world, I want to start introducing the feed/content reading views and some options for them to expand their world, while of course also fixing the UI issues & solving problems that have been described and discovered/caused as part of the first two sprints.
