Goal:
1. Finish tutorial. Now that we have no extra pages, everything needs to stay in the index route. Make the tutorial easy to follow, make sure that everything is explained to the user
2. Give the user a helpful guide (sort of like the PvZ almanac?) about every action, item and thing to do
3. API routes so that every current classification can be repeated
4. Pipeline (narrative-wise) for users to go from "completing" their first planet to going to other ones, including finishing "basePlanets" collection

Sectors will not be a part of this sprint.
