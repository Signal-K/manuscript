# Initial thoughts
There were a few things that we need to go over that weren't quite finished, however, I'm pretty happy with how this sprint went. It was my first sprint that I was actively managing and attempting to get sorted out on time, and it was also one of the few with a strict and achievable goal in a short time frame.

The goals were pretty simple:
> Create the frontend components required for the first 5 (frontend) "missions" to be able to be completed
