> The goal of this sprint was to get the missions all done in the index route, make things clearer and easier to follow. We achieved most of that and now have a plan for the final steps for a soft launch.

We need to introduce a hot refresh of the components every time a mission is completed so that we don't have to manually refresh the pages.

Rocks, soil, atmosphere

I'd recommend taking a look at [[Global & Internal To-Do]] for some things that are left over...
