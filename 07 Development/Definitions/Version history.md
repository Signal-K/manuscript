At the completion of every sprint, we'll be releasing a new staging version of the frontend client of Star Sailors. We now have a view of what we want to have in V2.0 of #Star-Sailors , so I think we should start planning out sprints week by week until we have all of those goals accomplished.

Before ~21st of November 2023, we were actively working on V1.0 of Star Sailors. After this, we began working on a new UI and started working on what would be called "V2.0". A few weeks ago we started fixing up our development environments and practices and set some new things up. However, everything still syncs across nicely

# Naming convention
We'll be naming major versions after notable space bodies, with V1.0 retrospectively being titled "Star Sailors: ". V2.0 will be titled "Star Sailors: "

Minor versions (2.x) will be named after animals or characters, and hotfixes (2.x.x) will be followed by a colour and an integer:
1. Red -> fix bug, security flaw, other issue
2. Blue -> add storyline content
3. Yellow -> add data/content
4. Green -> UI improvements/component changes

Hotfixes will mainly be tied around sprints, I think.

An example:
Two hotfixes are released to deal with bugs for V2.1:
1. 2.1.1 -> Red Owl 1
2. 2.1.2 -> Red Owl 2

Our pre-release versions (i.e. pre-V2.0) will be named after entities in the `Tenrecidae` family. As of now, we've prepared the first one to match with [SGV2-40 Sprint](obsidian://open?vault=Liam's%20vault&file=07%20Development%2FRetrospectives%2FFirst%20Mission%20Group%20-%20SGV2-40%20Retrospective) :
1. Star Sailors Pre-release 2.1.1: _Echinops telfairi_ 

The next release will be titled 2.1.2: _Setifer setosus_ 

I think once we complete the ~rough~ outline of the "First hour of gameplay" features [in relation to the currently planned sprints], we'll be able to go to Pre-release 2.2 stage
