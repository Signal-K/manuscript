# Narrative questions:
Why are we classifying animals? Where do they come from?
2. Actually, why are we doing anything? This needs to be explained to the users specifically
	1. When the user chooses each mission, we need to explain to them exactly where the data comes from (from an in-game/narrative lore perspective, not in a literal sense), why they're classifying it, etc
3. Explain to the users their ability to keep classifying using their existing structures, move on to new ones, again why...from a "completing our understanding of your planet" perspective #Generator
