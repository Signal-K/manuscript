# Construction
Building on from [[Mining Operations|Mining Operations]], construction & refining (read: changing the behaviour/makeup of mined resources) is the next step in the user's journey in [[01 Chapter 1|01 Chapter 1]], as they'll need some resources to build up their structures and find some data points.

## Refining & manufacturing
Steps:
1. We'll have items coming out of one (of many) "collection/silo" structures on a conveyer belt, users will be able to select these
2. They'll meet in a manufacturing module (stamper/melter/etc) that will then combine them into an item and then pump them into a silo at the end

Users will be able to choose the items that are coming out of each silo, what is being built, and each mission (in the mission log) will also have a configuration so after clicking on it, it automatically sets up your manufacturing belts

# Gardens & Citizen modules
Essentially these are "plant, wait, reward" plot points - perform one or multiple actions, wait for a period of time or for an event, get a reward/next step

This also links into terraforming. Essentially, users will have the community events and classifications from their mission log in here.

Concepts:
1. Incubation chambers for lifeforms, based on the planet (or an Earth simulation)
2. Growing/farming life in general (to transport/sell them)
3. Observing how life may form, experiments to simulate formation of life/other behaviours (e.g. Miller-Urey experiment), then taking it into the realm of science fiction by having that life actually take shape

Early-game, the #zoodex module will only look at Earth-based life in the new planet's environment, the relationship changes between predator/prey, etc. Users will need special tools, explore more of the setting/planet to discover life.

Items/Buildings
1. Greenhouse 
	1. Show animation of plants (ðŸª´) in dirt, nutrients sliding into the plant? ðŸ˜‚ (grid pattern)
2. Stasis chamber?

Early-game, we'll have a "colonised/explored" planet that users can go to try out these mechanics on "real" aliens
* To unlock this, they'll need to do a SETI project to be "invited"
