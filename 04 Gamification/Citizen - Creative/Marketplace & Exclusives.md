Initial ideas:
1. There are some entities/anomalies that are exclusive to specific planets or parent anomalies/settings (e.g. certain roover photos or plants)
2. These give some upgrades, boosts, cosmetic improvements, and help unlock tech (they boost tech?). Provide some other interaction - e.g. pets that have certain features/ideal properties, rocks that do something
3. Your planet "grows" the more you classify, allowing you to then build structures on top to improve/change terraforming process
4. "Idols" from your planet/setting-anomaly allow you to switch between [terraformed] states
5. Narrative/in-lore - allows Earth/solar-system-based content to be discovered/"experimented" with on your planet (also helping to paint a picture of that anomaly/setting (location))
6. Settlements & colonies - automatIons
