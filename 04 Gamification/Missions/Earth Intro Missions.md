I'm relatively happy with the overall flow where we introduce the user to the gameplay by having them pick the classification modules that interest them the most, and then gradually researching new topics that interest them. I guess now that we're starting on Earth and there's a clear divide between Earth and the other planets, it will be easier to come up with a divide and where #Chapter-2 starts.

This new chapter will require much more data to be available, especially around the #zoodex components. 

### Interaction types
1. Repairing structures
2. Building structures
3. Using structures -
	1. Finding data (retrieval)
	2. Making classifications
	3. Resource collection/building (secondary)
4. Researching structures/technology
5. Modifying/customising items
	1. e.g. Automaton upgrades

We need to ensure that all the base mechanics are introduced during the early missions. I think we might need to add more classification options as compulsory before they can visit their "first" planet, not entirely sure about this, though.

## Proposed mission list
I think we might need to update the #Onboarding format to just be a simple profile creation and then deposit them straight onto #Earth as we're just going to be introducing them to the mechanics currently in #Onboarding during the Earth-based missions anyway; additionally it allows our users to be brought straight into the action rather than boring them with a basic, web2.0 interface for immediate actions post-registration.

I also think that we can bring our users straight into the planet "creation"/colonisation phase as part of the current sprint (set) as we already have most of the meta set up, and the basic #Classifications you'll be able to perform have already been created:
1. #Clouds 
2. #RoversS #APPEEARs 
3. Anything in #Telescope #Structures 

So for the new #Chapter-1 , we'll actually build into #Chapter-2 a little bit by allowing the user to settle a new planet. I think to maintain narrative integrity it would be ideal to have each #Chapters teach the user a new mechanic, platform or set of #Modules ; for example the first planet they visit will be one of the 6 most [potentially] habitable planets ( #basePlanets ), which will sort of allow them free reign; later they'll learn the first steps of [individual-user based] terraforming, and then new classification modules will become available based on the #planetTypes the user visits. Users are therefore able to have a bit more control and clarity over their path i.e. what they want to do in the game (explorer, trader, etc). The only common thread is it all revolves around #Classifications .

Resource management might have to be done a little differently because it's not really feasible to have (what would essentially be) toy rovers performing mining actions on a planet as populated as Earth. Perhaps something like the "Space Agency" buildings in "Mars Horizon" could be applicable?

So immediately after #Registration we'll set the user onto their little pocket of " #Earth " and instantiate everything:
1. Initialise #Chapter-1  - #Meta

Missions I propose we keep:
1. #Chapter-1 Initialisation
2. First classification
3. First repair / building a structure

Missions I'm not sure about:
1. Rover mining - 
	1. How do we teach users how to use #Automatons and to classify their photos; find resources?
	2. How do we "replace" (or should we?) #Automatons for resource collection and management? Mining stations?

Missions I propose we add:
1. Greenhouse [[15 September 2024 Personal]]
2. Volcanic activity?
3. Some landscaping can be performed (possibly) on the first #planet the user visits (see [[Transition]])
4. #zoodex ocean/fish research
5. Seeding the life on Earth (and taking some "seeds" or animal pods with you (see [[Narrative megadoc dump]]))

Because we'll have more time to add to essentially the same chapter, we're going to have to add more content and data to classify, we have the time so we need to manage it effectively.

#PostCards / #Generator will also be differently managed, but the current draft component we have will suffice as it shows all classifications.

We'll have to add content to explain the realism and purpose of every action in-game

### For "ending" the mission
1. We must have a "pathway" component to show the user what they're able to do and some different options they have for the narrative they want to do
2. We must have something to extend each existing structure, and a coherent way to upgrade/add functionality
3. #Starnet - should we implement this? #Feed ?
