    <title>Post Create Form</title>
    <link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/Star-Sailors/Forms/CreatePostForm</link>
    <guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/Star-Sailors/Forms/CreatePostForm</guid>
    <description>Overview Contains three functions: CreatePostForm() → For creating posts based on a planet/anomaly id RoverContentPostForm() → Creating posts based on a rover image FactionPostForm() → Creating posts that will show up in a faction’s feed Order of operations CreatePostForm() Takes an id of a planet (and has the potential to take a category id too, however this hasn’t yet been implemented) Has the capacity for experience/currency, user avatars, media uploading state, however this functionality has currently been removed as we are re-working the currency experience User inserts their content into a textarea component Table: posts_duplicates (v1), classifications (v2) RoverContentPostForm() Takes the metadata of the rover’s image (NASA Appears API), a direct link to the image (extracted from the full metadata), and the sector the image came from (tied to basePlanetsSectors table) Currently there are two functions for inserting a post into the contentROVERIMAGES table, it appears that the handlePostSubmit function is the one actively being used Takes the author (user id, foreign key), metadata, image link, content (post content), media (currently no capacity for uploading media/files, however the table does support this - just not implemented on client-side), and the sector (which replaces the planet/basePlanet columns) Table: contentROVERIMAGES.</description>
