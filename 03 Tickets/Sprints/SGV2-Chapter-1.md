## SGV2-121 (Post cards)
[[Planet Generator]]
What I think we’ll do for the post card is we’ll have the planet avatar (we’ll need to increase the resolution for this), which you can then flip around to see a view of the landscape (we’ll have a basic landscape image we’ll apply a [colour] filter over to adjust how it looks for different planet types.

Show basic properties, discovery list, structures & other entities

Customisation scope →

1. You can choose the colour of the filter (within a range based on planet type)

We’ll also add a post card for other anomaly types with similar customisation formats.
