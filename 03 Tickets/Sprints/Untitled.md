Goals:
> Build the introductory scenes for Chapter 2 (first "new" planet the user visits in the #solar-system, specialised missions & modules, introduce planet types, minimal base building & resource collection; end with finding new exoplanets the user settles. Minimal planets.sector / anomalies.sector work)

> Improve the UI, UX, squash any bugs and implement feedback for Chapter 1, tie into Chapter 2 starting scene/missions better and add anything that (may) be missing
