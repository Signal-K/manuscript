For the new scene ( [[Earth Intro Missions]]), I think we'll be requiring the following infrastructure:
1. All data to be organised and collected, with correct seed data, including for storage (or, at a minimum, a backup and archival process for every storage bucket)
2. We'll need to take a look at the table schema and see if there's anything we can do there to streamline our ecosystem
3. New database standards (see [[Database]])

[[README]]
### Asset requirements
1. New background
2. Icons for every `action` or `button`
3. Icons for every structure

Maybe some #Gizmonauts -inspired assets? :)
