## Retrospectives
1. [Week 4](https://signalk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AGP/whiteboard/46530568)
2. [Chapter One Preparation](https://signalk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AGP/whiteboard/46497803) 

Building on from [SGV2-154] (planning for chapter 1).

Tickets from `SGV2-154` we're moving into this epic:
1. `SGV2-158` 
2. `SGV2-132`
3. `SGV2-118`
4. `SGV2-172`
5. `SGV2-138`

Old tickets that need to be referenced:
1. `SGV2-171`: Configuration for structures, [including child `SGV2-172`] 

Discussing the [[Timeline]]:
1. User chooses the first thing they want to classify
	1. Animal, weather, rover photos, lightcurve
	2. Explain to the user each discipline, how they lead into other (future) disciplines, and what's required
	3. Create the relevant structure, give them the starting syntax
2. After one use, they need to go and collect some resources
	1. Point towards the "Automaton" structure, which now has mining unlocked
	2. Show what they need to collect/do
3. Users will craft up some basic repairs to their structures and can then continue
4. Piece-by-piece fill in the planet (we'll define "classification levels" based on individual user's efforts and overall platform, showing a graph overview for between all `anomalies` )
5. ...
6. Telescope to find new planet

To-Do:
1. Component for dialogue (for these chapter components) -> Capt'n Cosmos?
2. Create pointer structure
3. Define how each mission is linked, between structures, citizen science #Modules and inventory items/other missions (the entirety of chapter 1. Create every possible order/combination)
4. What can they use the telescope for other than finding new planets in #Chapter-1 , is this doable?

### User classification choice steps
1. User starts chapter 1, creating their initial structures & infrastructure
	1. For their first planet, they're given an "Automaton structure" and *n* almost-broken structures for classification purposes
2. Then they're asked what they'd like to do on the planet first (`ClassificationChoice`)
3. They're given a tutorial, can make one classification, the structure breaks
	1. At any point in this step (#3) they can change their structure/classification mission

The planet view will present a modal first that discusses the points of step 1 in #Chapter-1 

Alien progression:
1. User will have to make the relevant classifications to determine the overall scope of the planet, they can then discuss what sort of life/chances could exist based on these properties. We'll send out some sneaky easter eggs that could point towards one thing or another
2. We'll send them some signals that *may* have been received from that planet long ago, as well as some biosignatures (target them towards/customised to the planet's stats). For #Chapter-1 , it will just be to be able to receive biosignatures, and they will be stored in the #Greenhouse structure
