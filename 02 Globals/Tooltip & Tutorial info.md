# Structures
* Telescope - "Use this to discover and catalogue potential new planets"
* Camera module - "Use this to view places your rovers have been"
* Automaton module - "Upgrade and maintain your rovers and [other] automatons"
* #zoodex - "Help Cosmos keep track of animal behaviour on your planet"

A lot of this is dependant on how we display which components, and where, but overall that's relatively fine.

# Onboarding
Capt'n Cosmos walks the users through everything alright, I think. Maybe step 4 ( [[Planet Generator|Planet Generator]] ) could use some work, but apart from that I'm happy

# Chapter 1
We'll need to bring CC back when the user navigates to the new planet page, as well as for each new mechanic (see [[Overall component list|Overall component list]]). Once we have the mechanics all listed I think we can start writing the script

# Jira
* [SGV2-112](https://signalk.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SGV2/boards/8?selectedIssue=SGV2-112)
