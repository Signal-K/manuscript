# Hey Dylan
Right now, a lot of our notes are on Github, and it's quite a mess. I'm going to try to spend this weekend cleaning things up from an operational perspective, but here's what you need to know:
1. We just deleted Slack and haven't found an alternative yet. So messaging/snap will have to suffice for now
2. I'm going to invite you to the Jira project board, which is *currently* where we do project management. However, our notes & pm tickets may change soon. So don't get too attached to any tools.

## Here's some things you should look into:
Look through the following pages to get an understanding of the current narrative for #Star-Sailors  and where we're at from an operational standpoint (search the repository on github for these, I don't know how to manually link all of them rn):
1. "Timeline" [[Timeline]]
2. "Tickets" [[Tickets]]
3. "01 Chapter 1" [[01 Chapter 1]]
	1. "Mining Operations" [[Mining Operations]]
4. all files inside "Sprints" folder (03/Sprints) [[Sprints]] & "Epics" [[Epics]]
5. "Mission list" [[Mission list]]
6. "Automations & Pipelines" [[Automations & Pipelines]]
7. "Structure list"
8. "Basic recipes"
9. "03 September 2024" & "05 September 2024"

This should give you an understanding of what's going on. I'd also recommend taking a look at the videos I posted to Twitter at "@TheMrScrooby" as there's some demos and more in-depth discussion there

## Some things you should know
People:
1. Liam (that's me!) - head idiot
2. Rhys - frontend designer, collaborator
3. Fred - narrative & game art
4. Dave - board/advisor
I'll introduce you to all these guys shortly once we finally figure out what we're moving to from Slack

Tech stack for Star Sailors:
1. NextJS (frontend)
2. Flask (backend)
3. Postgres - Supabase (database, storage, networking, authentication)
Pretty simple
