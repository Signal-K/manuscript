# To review
1. ~~Planet selector (`/tests`)
2. ~~New planet routes~~
	3. ~~Including Earth~~~~
3. ~~Planet initialiser (and mission syntax)~~
4. ~~Build/edit mode (and show Voidpet screenshots)~~
5. ~~Current #Data-Sources & method (component) to unlock it~~
6. ~~Updated tech tree~~
7. ~~Updated structure flow including #Research~~ 

# To determine/answer: 
2. We need to determine minimum features/data sources [[01 Chapter 1 02/Classifications/Data sources|Data sources]]
3. ~~All questions in [[Chapter 1-2 Mission List]]need to be answered~~
4. Review component notes -> do we have enough gamification here?


# Components to review
1. Mining mechanics UI (from the mineral deposits scene)
2. Is the "available missions" in a structure relevant? Are we getting too confusing?
	1. Do we add missions to the data sources definition?
4. #Generator vs terrariums...

# Narrative
1. ~~Is the new planet idea a good one ( #Solar-System )~~
2. ~~What else should go in the #PlanetView / planet scene (specifically the #Earth #Scenes )~~

Minimum requirement is to get a full mission list (and order) for the entirety of the Earth scene, this means all structures, modules and items.

~~3. Do we bring greenhouses in this early? What about terraforming & habitats? - how does this all relate to #Earth ? Maybe just greenhouses?
	1. Seeding?
4. ~~What (outside of mining) can automatons do? - Building?~~
5. ~~Resource collection in the first Earth chapter~~
6. Sectors vs different planets (planets serving as chapters?)
7. When do #basePlanets come into play? (what chapter?) -> #Chapter-3 
8. When do we introduce factions or player types? -> #Chapter-2  (factions can wait)
9. Idea around [[In-Game Locations]]
10. [[Question megadump]] && [[Questions for testers]]~~

# User actions/mechanics
1. Crafting, refining - in relation to current #Research flow
	1. This can be pushed back to #Chapter-2 

# Dialogue
1. We need to get dialogue together for each "scene" (Structure module)
Really, configuring all the #Anomalies (matching up with `zoodexDataSources` #Data-Sources ) and getting the dialogue right (and then the order of operations) is the biggest battle rn, imo.

# Tutorials
1. After determining which modules/sources are to be part of the first chapter, we need to determine a tutorial structure, likely something that would mimic the tutorial in the relevant Zooniverse project

1. We also need to go over the classification options for each project -> just copy #Zooniverse 

# Assets
1. Icons, including for structure
2. Planet images for planet selector


# For Fred
1. Backstory behind every module/data source
2. Dialogue, dialogue, #Dialogue
