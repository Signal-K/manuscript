## Structures
1. Initialise #zoodex  structure -> give the user a choice based on the planet type (for now, they'll all get the same one to simplify things)
2. Then, create some test dialogue from the start of #Chapter-1  and integrate it into the flow
3. Initialise mission to get animals (maybe we start off with collecting some data from Earth, then we bring it to the planet in the #zoodex #Structures ). Ask Fred about this flow
4. Draw out landscape/layout for Chapter 1 in its current flow, and draw the order of operations based on Fred's initial start-to-finish plan
5. Draw designs for the game components (e.g. cross-section) and the proposed component mapping
6. Create research ticket and scope (it will also house "all discoveries" and the documentation)
7. Provide an update to the #Generator #PostCards component, maybe overhaul (just show the number of discoveries). Look into creating a spinning ball that can be divided into segments 
8. Populate data for everything else, describe potential roadmap for automating this and automate the planet creation process (can we export the EXOFOP db ordered by date last submitted?)
9. Fix/attempt to fix github action for supabase storage, db backup

Move all of these into #Tickets
