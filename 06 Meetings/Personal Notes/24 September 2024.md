# Cleo
1. Proposed data structures, sources and modals - at least 3 per structure (excluding automaton station)
2. Proposed tutorial for each module

# Mrkt
1. What else can we do with the Automaton station (classification-wise or building/action)

1. ~~Just send rovers out (no classifications for #Earth chapter), have a radius and a time of deploy, to find data sources~~
2. ~~Is the new planet idea a good one ( #Solar-System ) (yes, just cross reference planets with the closest solar system entity)~~
3. Once we get some plant classifications, greenhouses become relevant. Terraforming goes in #Chapter-2 or #Chapter-3 
	1. So the next thing to do is to find a plant/seed-related module
4. Automaton (new) usecases -
	1. Building structures (post #Chapter-1 )/managing refineries
	2. Any subsequent, relevant classifications
5. Getting tutorial structure will probably just follow #Zooniverse convention
