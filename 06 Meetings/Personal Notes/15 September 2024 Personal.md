Add a configuration for the classification so we know which mission the user was doing for the classification (helps us identify which #Chapters )

For `SGV2-200` / `#148`:
1. Fix mission order and `profiles.activeMission` values & discriminators
2. Put dialogue and all components into the `CaptnCosmos/Guidebot` function, ensure user gets all required information and all actions (e.g. setting `profiles.activeMission`, completing #Classifications ) are possible
3. Fix any layout/styling issues for `guidebot` [[^]]\
Add dialogue from [[Chapter 1]]
