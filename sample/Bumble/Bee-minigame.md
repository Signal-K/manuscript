Scope - I need to first determine the best format for building the demo. Swift is out for now, as I want it to be accessible on my Nothing (3a). Godot, Unity or Expo are the remaining options.

The background will not be a static image, it will be composed of layers -
1. Crop
2. Soil patch
3. Terrain (grassy/foreground)

The background will have clouds and terrain that can later be derived from the user's citizen science contributions.
For now, we'll have the weather be tied to the user's location, this will add a small effect bonus to the growth rate. 

The goal is for the user to increase the number of pollinators that visit their garden. I do think that there should be some other kind of motive or mechanic. Perhaps we focus on introducing the user to the different bee species, as an educational game. 

Users will be able to sell their crops or turn them into fertilizer. 

There will be different missions each week. As well as achievements (look into widgets and iOS/android achievement toolkit/gameKit).

Then, let's set up tables for where the bees are, countdown timers for the next growth, bee interaction, etc.

# Immediate alterations - #SSG-290 sprint
[[SSG-290]]
1. Add 3 more plots, add more texture, uniform sizes, squircle shapes for the plots rather than square/rectangular
2. Move the grass up to cover the bottom 45% of the display, plots should be on top of the grass
3. Add a planet svg icon for the button on the bottom menu
