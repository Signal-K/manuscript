# Onboarding [[Onboarding|Onboarding]]
(structures aren't initialised but the base functionality is included)
1. Telescope - find transit events, convert to a readable lightcurve image and make a classification
2. Rover camera receiver - including deploying the rovers/automatons

# Chapter 1 [[01 Chapter 1|01 Chapter 1]]
See [[Basic recipes|Basic recipes]]
1. Telescope - 
	1. Find new transit events (only available if user has begun to classify the current/active planet OR if they've chosen to become an "explorer" (in which case we'll need to invent a spaceship mechanic too))
	2. View planet data (and other module/structures)
	3. View tutorial & documentation for lightcurves
		Users are able to upgrade telescopes to find modified/more complex lightcurves e.g. phase-folded, pixel light file
2. #zoodex -
	1. We still need to determine the user experience & item relational structure for this
	2. [["What animal is this?"|"What animal is this?"]]
3. Rover camera receiver, rover/automaton module
