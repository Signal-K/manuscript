I think we should introduce an intermediary stage between raw materials and structures, e.g. "microchips", "servos", "cameras", etc.

During the initial/early stages of gameplay (e.g. [[01 Chapter 1]] [[Structure list]]), the first things available [to craft] will be the initial structures, which will include:
1. Telescope
2. "Animal lure" / camera loop (this is likely something we'll have to ask some questions about - the #zoodex is a moveable component in-game, so is the structure just something that lures the animals/life in? Do we have multiple structures that are linked and provide some boost utility? - anywhosal, for now I'll just go with "animal module")
3. LIDAR station (ground-based) with weather balloons and orbiting [monitoring] satellites (boosts, I don't think all of them would be required) for collecting cloud (and other weather data)
Any other early-game structures would depend on what modules we want to include (and can feasibly develop) in #Chapter-1 

We'll also need a power source for structures, so maybe some solar panels?

## Intermediary items
1. Camera
2. "Flotation device" ðŸ˜‚
3. Magnifying glass
4. Magnets
5. Microcontroller
6. Microchip
7. Lens
8. "Networking device" - would likely be an "inter-intermediary" step
9. Engine, fuel store/tank
10. Servo

Here's a list of the current minerals (from [[Automaton - Rover configuration]]):
1. Silicon 
2. Iron 
3. Nickel 
4. Alloy 
6. Copper 
7. Chromium
8. Water/water-ice

I think I'm going to rename "water" to "Water-Ice" and include a refining step, refining/melting will NOT be part of the mining/extraction process
