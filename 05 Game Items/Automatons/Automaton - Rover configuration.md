# Speed
Affects the speed the rover goes at, not how fast they mine things (this will depend on power level)

# Capacity
How many of one deposit the rover can bring back

# Power
What the rover can mine, and how fast they mine

Here's a list of the current minerals:
1. Silicon 
2. Iron 
3. Nickel 
4. Alloy 
5. Fuel
6. Copper 
7. Chromium
8. Water

Let's say that Water will require a power level of 2 (as you'll need to transform it from a water ice deposit I'm assuming, or dig really deep). Fuel is something that is probably refined, not a mineral, so I think we should remove it.
Everything else there would be relatively easy to mine, I think.
