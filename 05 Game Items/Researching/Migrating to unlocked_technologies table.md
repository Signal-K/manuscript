Currently we use `inventory` table to perform the functionality for "researching" technology, however we need to move to a new table or create a new item type in `inventory`, as the current #Research #Structure shows items/ #Structures on your [instance of] planet as items you've researched; there's not a record of research activities overall. 

I'm weighing up whether or not to try to squeeze this into the #Chapter-1 sprint.
