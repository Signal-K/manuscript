# Crafting recipes
## Notes
These will all be updated & modified as we add more materials to `inventoryITEMS` table. That reminds me, building this new microservice will make editing the recipes so much easier on my end.

I think we're also going to need to update the method for how sectors are created and viewed. Especially the UI.
