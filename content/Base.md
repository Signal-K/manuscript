Single scrollable content column again? How do we make this like a game and not a social network? Perhaps this could be useful once we get a significant userbase. Integrate with other networks e.g. mastodon?

### Design Principles

1. **Exploration and Discovery**: Focus on user exploration and discovery of new planets and alien life forms.
2. **Base Building**: Incorporate resource management and base-building elements inspired by games like Hades Star and NMS.
3. **Narrative Engagement**: Create engaging storylines and missions that guide players through the universe.
4. **Resource Management**: Players should manage and gather resources for survival and growth.
5. **Variety of Environments**: Introduce a diverse range of star types, planets, and alien life forms.
6. **User Interaction**: Encourage user participation and contributions to the game world.
7. **Flexible Gameplay**: Allow different play styles, including text-based and visual explorations.
8. **Multiplayer Elements**: Develop multiplayer features for user interaction and competition.

### Plans/Ideas

1. **Character Customisation**: Allow users to select their character type, home planet, and play style at the start.
2. **Mission Matching**: Assign starter missions based on user preferences to guide them in collecting resources and advancing.
3. **Visual vs. Text-based Content**: Decide between a simple text/image-based experience or a more complex 3D world.
4. **Data Representation**: Explore ways to represent data such as light curves in a more engaging way.
5. **Narrative Focus**: Create a narrative centered around discovering aliens and life forms to maintain user interest.
6. **Star Types and Planetary Habitats**: Define different star and planet types and the potential for habitability.
7. **Gameplay Structure**: Develop a structure that starts with exploring a chosen base planet and then expands to more complex interactions.
8. **User Retention**: Aim for high user retention by offering compelling gameplay and frequent content updates.

### Tasks

1. **Design Character Selection Screen**: Create an initial screen for users to select their character and preferences.
2. **Create Starter Missions**: Develop initial missions that match user preferences and guide them in-game.
3. **Decide on Visual Style**: Choose between a simple text/image-based experience or a 3D world for exploration.
4. **Implement Data Representation**: Develop methods for representing scientific data (e.g., light curves) in an engaging way.
5. **Establish Base Planetary Types**: Define different base planet types, including resources and environments.
6. **Develop Narrative Structure**: Craft storylines around exploring alien life and planets.
7. **Introduce Multiplayer Features**: Plan and implement multiplayer elements for user interaction.
8. **Optimize for Mobile**: Ensure the game is optimized for mobile devices for accessibility and user retention.

These principles, plans/ideas, and tasks can guide the development of the project to create an engaging, interactive, and immersive experience for users.
