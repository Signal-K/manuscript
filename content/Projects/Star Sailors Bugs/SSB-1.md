Determine how many of the utils/icon files in the v2 are being used

~~PlanetList â†’ garden components. Multiple different options~~ -> We already need to re-design the garden, and make it both mobile-friendly and fit in with the overlays

~~Provide another rebuild for the native app~~ -> Now that we've switched over to using `next-pwa` for the pwa build, we no longer need to use Capacitor. Obviously once we want to add features like push notifications, widgets etc we may need to produce another build framework, but I think it's more likely we'll develop native apps using RN or Swift.

Is there a tutorial for multi-paragraph threads via Supabase embeddings? Plus comments demo?

* Sector page -> planet name is set to "unknown" for individual sectors.
