Minimum requirement ->
1. Allow users to build structures on a planet's sector
2. Require classification to do so (this will, for now, be contingent on the user having set a `basePlanet` as their `profiles.location` field, which right now is done via fiddling with the backend -> but it could be considered to be an equivalent barrier)
3. Link the structure that has just been placed to the next step of classification. Provide a pathway to generate additional context/information once the user has placed that structure.

A child issue, GP-11, has been created and will be targeted towards the microservice for validating correct items & crafting recipes.

Some additional context has been added to the Jira issue, which has been handballed to Rhys for completion/filing
