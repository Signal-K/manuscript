## Announcements

Date: October 09 2023
We have an updated timeline for Lens V2 launch - **TLDR: V2 mainnet is scheduled for October 30 2023.** Here are the updates: _**Mainnet launch of Lens V2 is scheduled for October 30 2023.**_ The Lens V1 API will continue to work, but will go into read-only mode on October 30th and will only have old V1 data. Writes will not work on that API after we pause it but will still be readable for a month or so. If you missed it, we held a live call presenting Lens V2 and taking questions from the developer community, you can view a recording of the call here: [https://hey.xyz/posts/0x28a2-0x075f-DA-e248a136](https://hey.xyz/posts/0x28a2-0x075f-DA-e248a136 "https://hey.xyz/posts/0x28a2-0x075f-DA-e248a136") You can also view the documentation for Lens V2 here: [https://docs.lens.xyz/v2/docs/](https://docs.lens.xyz/v2/docs/ "https://docs.lens.xyz/v2/docs/") _If you or your team need one-one-one help or assistance, please reach out to us. We will prioritize Lens V2 migration assistance over the coming weeks._
