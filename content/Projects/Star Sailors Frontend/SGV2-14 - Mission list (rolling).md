const [missions, setMissions] = useState([

{ name: "Pick your home planet", completed: false },

{ name: "Build your first rover", completed: false },

{ name: "Collect your first resources", completed: false },

{ name: "Build your first structure", completed: false },

]);

Note -> as per SGV2-20, missions 1 & 2 (and maybe others) will technically be completed by the onboarding process...but good to keep them in here for now.
