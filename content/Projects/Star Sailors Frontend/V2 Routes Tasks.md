# Planets
1. I think that all structures on a planet's sectors will be accessible from the planet page, eventually. For now, this is going to cause all sorts of issues, so let's hold off on this for now.
2. How does tree data affect what's going on here?2
## Sectors
* Generated bg images/maps for each sector route
* Generate complete make-up/composition when creating a new sector, including confirming that the rover images change each time

## Data
* Need to get planet data to filter into sector data - currently it's all disorganised see ![[Pasted image 20240415133401.png]]

# Index
* I think we'll show the user's spaceships, automations, and planet charicatures on the index route. At the bottom we'll have the navigation area, which will allow for the accordions to be selected
* .limit(3); // Set this to be owned planets -> for planet gallery card/garden
* It appears now that the sectors can be visited from the dashboard (i.e. the deeplinks work!)
* Perhaps we could show a grouping of public sectors underneath the accordion area?
* Could the bg image be made up of a representation of your colony? "Our space colony".mp3
