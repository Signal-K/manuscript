# Planets
1. I think that all structures on a planet's sectors will be accessible from the planet page, eventually. For now, this is going to cause all sorts of issues, so let's hold off on this for now.
2. How does tree data affect what's going on here?2
## Sectors
* Generated bg images/maps for each sector route
* Generate complete make-up/composition when creating a new sector, including confirming that the rover images change each time

## Data
* Need to get planet data to filter into sector data - currently it's all disorganised see ![[Pasted image 20240415133401.png]]

# Explore
* Sector route -> [[Explore.tsx]] 
* Fix background image issue on `/explore/[id].tsx` route

# Index
* I think we'll show the user's spaceships, automations, and planet charicatures on the index route. At the bottom we'll have the navigation area, which will allow for the accordions to be selected
* .limit(3); // Set this to be owned planets -> for planet gallery card/garden
* It appears now that the sectors can be visited from the dashboard (i.e. the deeplinks work!)
* Perhaps we could show a grouping of public sectors underneath the accordion area?\
		* I'm having a go at experimenting with what could go below the accordions, currently we've got the sectors & inventory working. Defeats the purpose of the accordions, but while they've been a good stopgap at helping me/us figure out what needs to be shown, I think (thanks toÂ [@Rhys Campbell](https://signalkineticsgroup.slack.com/team/U05MVAXPMCL)) that we've possibly found a better way.  
* Could the bg image be made up of a representation of your colony? "Our space colony".mp3

* The onboarding area/index page could house a bento box until we get the user comfortable with the VP-minimal UI
* Bento box -> your planet, your vehicle, citizen module, mission list, inventory
* Possibly we could have an option to toggle the bentogrid component, or highlight the missions. Determining if this is a feasible compromise and when/how to execute/introduce this will be a decision for Rhys
* Another big error -> too many components on the page causes the scroll to go past background/cover image.
* Or could your "home page" just be an interactable home base with a menu? So essentially take `/planets/{[your]id}` and move that to index route?

# Collecting resources
* Same structure as with the old crypto game from 2022 -> just send a rover there and have it eat up supplies? Create a function that will determine how long the rover has been "mining", then click "end", microservice calculates rewards
* I was thinking that we could possibly have a very stripped back control panel for mobile, maybe even only one function, but then I remembered that it will be a mobile-first (or in theory, anyway, at minimum it will need feature parity between desktop and mobile) deliverable and thus we can't lock features out of the mobile inference.
	* Put everything into a bento grid.
	* We could have a side-scrolling section that shows all the information/context
	* Control panel/control(ler)s, camera, and then data/information

* Error: using the `AddResourceToInventory` button on `planets/sector/{$id}` does NOT add a sector value. I am assuming this is a bug as we do have a discriminator in the component definition, and not that this is intended to be the case (e.g. structures will be confined to a sector/planet, while items may not be by default? But should they at least show where they originate from)

# Classifications
* I think we should move everything into a single `classifications` table, have a single table for everything that is going to be catalogued, and then differentiate between them in the same way we have a single table for every item type. I will review this with Dave.
* Each sector has a series (currently one, could be multiple though) of images from a rover, which can be classified (and would then return a reward, theoretically allowing us to structure the inventory/items component into this)

# Structures
* I just realised that the telescope selector doesn't require the telescope to exist on the planet (afaik at the moment)
	* We have done this successfully for the sectors/{$id} route, though, which is good.


## Hosting
* We'll host all the flask API(s) on a few raspberry Pis, thanks to Rhys
