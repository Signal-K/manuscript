Will (obviously) add more dynamic tags, properties and set up inheritance based on jira export.

This will essentially serve as a boilerplate/canvas for all the UI tasks we need to do.

### To clean up:
1. Sectors page
2. Individual sector page
3. Individual planet page
4. Garden
5. Workflow/order of operations - it begins in the nav
6. Onboarding after signup -> currently on `initialClassification` branch

Click on Unity block -> open web-based context?

### To look into:
1. Hexagons & sectors, data using `d3.js`
	1. For the sector maps, one of the goals was to have a single image that is split into multiple hexagons, right now it's a grid of squares (masquerading as "hexagons") that each have a separate "cover" image
2. Boilerplating/microservice to migrate from custom `base...` tables to regular tables once we've added multiple collections

### Organisation
* Complete `Components` & `Pages` dir in the notes
* Establishing understanding of branches & current tasks, archived jira tasks/branches
* Can we get a coherent structure & understanding of what files are relevant, what (non-default) functions are being put in secondary files, etc
