A note that all blocks fetching dynamic route content will use the following parameters for each table:
* `basePlanets` -> '2'

Current blocks to-do:

## Planet/anomaly data
* Lightcurve box/generator, content placeholder function
		Not doing this for now because the activation method is quite complex and I'm thinking we do it based on structures, so we need to sort that out first

## Rover
* Create menu for structures in rover HUD series of blocks
Ultimately we need to identify where everything is going to be done, maybe the control panel can be considered more of a general/all-purpose control panel rather than one specifically for the roover. Or maybe sort of dynamic, like a smartphone keyboard (button changing)

A test case needs to be completed to deploy rovers from sectors, but first we need to build that into the database

## "All functionality"
Back when I was working on accordions:
> Ok, so technical update, from a user-interaction perspective ->Home dashboard now has these 6 sections/accordions. So everything that the user does, or can do, is going to sync up through these somehow. For the onboarding, we need to take everything from the narrative and figure out what section it should go into, and then the order it comes in (i.e. sometimes missions will be able to be done without requiring the other one to be complete, other times "things to do" won't be unlocked/visible until you've done something else prior).Will work on a confluence megadoc to get all this into a list.
