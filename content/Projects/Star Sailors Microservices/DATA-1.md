Like FLASK-1, this will be linked with live Jira/plane tags/code shortly

Goal -> pull data from anomaly tags to customise how the UI & elements of anomalies look.
The simplest thing I can think of is potentially customising the orientation & setup of sector "deposits" (height/"priority" of generation and noise) based on anomaly data. There is a wealth of APPEEARS data to look into as well.

Every structure that the player unlocks on their sectors will be able to unlock more data streams, more things to classify, and therefore more thing to do (a consideration will need to be made to ensure that classification + things to do is together, i.e. the classification needs to be the end mechanic, not simply a task to be done to get a reward). 

I have also just realised that currently structures are placed on sectors, which means that we need to look into preventing users from duplicating structures, or potentially increasing "potency".
