1. Come up with todo list & structure by the hour -> including for the hours we're having our coffee
2. Dynamic plan for keepup, including logo
3. Check "promised" timeline for nk12 and prepare daily milestones
4. Contact Manu and produce a list of 10 components, provide a bit of discussion
5. Create plan for microservices, integration into `sytizen`, workflow for Unity (including action), discuss plan for integrating new UI & actions with microservices, automated tests.
	1. d3.js v0.dev based on lightcurves?
6. Continue with migration to Quartz

### Microservices
1. Method for generating lightcurve, integrating into d3
2. Method/route for populating anomaly/entity data -> sample, point to old routes in `signal-k/sytizen` repo

### Nordkurve
Phase 1 ->
1. Registration, migration and schema setup
2. "Backend" portal (really a frontend, though, technically) for admins/board to view all data

### Keepup
What we have now ->
1. Bottom bar
2. Main area/content grid

Minimum viable product ->
1. Push notifications
2. Method to create a feed
3. Posts will be pushed from a local dictionary for now -> no server-side action for this component
4. Ability to "favourite" posts/messages, these will be saved in runtime state
5. Post category

Post features:
1. Content
2. Avatar, title/user sender metadata
3. Favourite, user-determined metadata

### Copernic
Possible components:
1. Discussion board, based around bucket/node
	1. Discussion board would be divided into Lens & other protocols (for now, off-chain)
2. News feed for nodes
3. Metadata/custom tags (e.g. linking to a "proper" dsl node)
4. Documentation area -> just do it here on quartz for now
	1. Should include videos/tutorials on how to use our platform
5. Physical data tracker -> could be especially useful for copernic passports?
6. Ask gpt for another 5.

Focus on minimal/incomplete UI, the priority is reasoning, brainstorming, documentation and minimum functionality for presentation

### Travel
Key dates:
1. May 18 -> Bayer Leverkusen vs FC Augsburg (11.30pm melbourne)
2. May 22 -> Europa League Final (Dublin) **
3. May 25 -> DFB Pokal Final (Berlin) **

So some options ->
* Go for the week
* Go for first two
* Go for second two

No other key conferences as far as I'm aware

Key questions ->
1. Is it worth focusing on achieving Velocity Platinum or trying to maximise United Airlines/Star Alliance? keeping in mind I'm going to the US at least one more time this year
